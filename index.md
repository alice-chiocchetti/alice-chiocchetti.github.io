I am currently a PhD student at the Paris School of Economics under the supervision of Gabriel Zucman. Before that, I graduated from Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure Paris-Saclay and Paris School of Economics.

### Research

I am interested generally in public finance and inequalities. More precisely, my current research focuses on understanding the use of tax havens by multinational firms and the firm determinants of inequalities.
