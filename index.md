I am currently a PhD student at Telecom Paris under the supervision of Slim Essid and Titouan Parcollet. Before that, I graduated from Ecole Polytechnique in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science, and I also hold a masters degree from ENS Paris-Saclay (MVA Program) in Machine Learning.

## Research

I am interested generally in Machine Learning applied to Language and Speech. More precisely, my current research focuses on understanding and motivating the choices in Self-supervised learning pipelines for speech.
